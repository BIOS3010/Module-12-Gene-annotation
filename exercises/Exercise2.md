### Exercise 2: Visualizing the Glimmer gene predictions in UCSC Genome browser
## 12.2.1 Downloading the ecoli.bed file to your own computer
In order to be able to visualize the results of our predictions, we will need the output file in our own computers, allowing us to upload the file to any visualization program we prefer.
Recall from the last week's lecture how you download files from the server to your computer.
```diff
! Download the `ecoli.bed` from the server to your own computer
```

## 12.2.2 Logging into UCSC genome browser to visualize the E. coli genome
The UCSC genome browser is a web-based browser. We have briefly looked at it earlier in the course. In this exercsise, we will use the “microbes” version of UCSC genome browser.

- Go to the following web-page: http://microbes.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=eschColi_K12 
- Clicking the link should bring you to a small part of the E. coli genome in the browser. 
- Familiarize yourself in the browser.

## 12.2.3 Uploading the ecoli.bed file to the UCSC Genome Browser
- Hold your mouse pointer over the “My Data” link a the top of the browser view and click “Custom Tracks”:
