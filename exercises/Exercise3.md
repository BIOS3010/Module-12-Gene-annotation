## 12.3.1 A script that computes the GC content
If you go back to the (optional) Python exercises from the first week, you will see that [one of the exercises](https://github.com/BIOS3010/Module-1-Unix-Python/blob/main/exercises/Python-exercise1.md#exercise-156) were about creating a function to compute GC-content. In Exercise [2.4.2](https://github.com/BIOS3010/Module-2-sequences/blob/main/exercises/Exercise2.md#242-reading-a-fasta-file-containing-multiple-sequences-into-seq-objects), you looked at code that read in fasta file. In this exercise, you will combine these two to make a script called `gccontent.py` that computes the GC content of a fasta file.

```diff
! Create a python script (gccontent.py) that computes GC content of a fasta file
! Run the script on the `ecoli.fa` file
! What is the computed GC content?
! How does this GC content compare with the output from the Glimmer tool?
```

Note that you have to run `Biopython/1.78-foss-2020a-Python-3.8.2` on the server to get access to Biopython.
